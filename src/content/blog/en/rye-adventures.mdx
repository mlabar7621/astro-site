Last weekend, I had the pleasure of going on an adventure with my friend Rayan. 
We marathon watched transformers 1-3, built a LEGO Technic Ferrari Daytona SP3, and threw a birthday party for our greek friend. 
I made garlic butter and he made shrimp and we had a dinner party with randoms who we invited by shouting from the balcony.
Lovely chap overall.
