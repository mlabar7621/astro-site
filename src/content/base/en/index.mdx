# Engineer & Traveller

    ### Passion 1: Engineering

    I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, and have practiced engineering since high school.
    I have designed my own model rockets and quadcopter drone, and have worked as part of a team to create pn-junction diodes, an autonomous multi-terrain vehicle, and a blood sepsis lab-on-a-chip device.

    ### Passion 2: Travel

    I love exploring new places, and have travelled to 15 countries thus far.
    When travelling, I prefer to go in-depth rather than wide, and often travel by bike to see the small towns as well as the big cities.
    Here you can see a map of everywhere I have ever been.
