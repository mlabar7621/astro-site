    ### Passion 1: Engineering

    I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, and have practiced engineering since high school.
    I have designed my own model rockets and quadcopter drone, and have worked as part of a team to create pn-junction diodes, an autonomous multi-terrain vehicle, and a blood sepsis lab-on-a-chip device.

    I love exploring new places, and have travelled to 15 countries thus far.
    When travelling, I prefer to go in-depth rather than wide, and often travel by bike to see the small towns as well as the big cities.
    Here you can see a map of everywhere I have ever been.

    ### Passion 2: Travel

    ### Passion 3: Language

    I have learned various languages in my life thus far, and intend to continue doing so in the future.
    As of now, I speak Russian, Belarusian, English, French, and German. All at least conversationally, some fluently, depending on your definition.

    I take plenty of photos when I travel, as well as doing astrophotography when I have the chance.
    Some of my work can be seen on my portfolio page.

    ### Passion 4: Photography
