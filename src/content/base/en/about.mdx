My name is Mikhail Labar, and I am currently a student of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. I made this website to serve as my digital resume, portfolio, contact page, and blog.

I am currently studying abroad in Munich, Germany, at Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences. 

Russian and Belarusian are my native languages, and I speak English at a native level. I learned French in high school, and German in College, and speak both fluently.

In my free time, I like to do woodworking and metalworking, some of which I post here. I also do amateur freestyle drone flying, for which I built my own drone. I paint and draw sometimes, but quite rarely.

In regards to sports, I like to hike, bike, and rock climb. I prefer challenging myself with duration rather than difficulty, doing 10-hour rides at 12 mph instead of 20-minute ones at 20 mph. I post reviews of some routes I’ve done on this site.
