This theme is based off of the lovely [Bear Blog](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/).

## Updates

Due to technical problems, this theme is not entirely modular when it come to language.

When adding a new locale, you must create new folders titled with the slug at:
- src\content\blog\
- src\pages\
- src\pages\blog

You must then copy the \tag blog folder into the new \blog\slug folder

You must then manually update/add your new slug in:
- src\i18n\locales.ts
- src\i18n\ui.ts
- every file in \pages\blog
